**Would you like to have a new chart available in Silky Charts? Please describe.**
Please tell us why you think Silky Charts should include this new chart in the library.

**Describe a couple of use cases**
Understanding the possible use cases of this new chart will help us to envision the creation and design of the new chart.

**Provide a visual representation or design**
Having a design beforehand will speed up the chart creation process, provide any screenshot or design you already have.

**Test data**
One of the most difficult things to find when you don't know a chart is to find the data which that chart will represent. Please provide an example dataset you will like to represent with this new chart.
