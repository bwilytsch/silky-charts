Issues on GitHub are intended to be related to problems with the library itself
and feature requests so we recommend not using this medium to ask them here üòÅ.

Please use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/silky-charts) to ask any question about Silky Charts and if you want you can let me know about it through Twitter [@DaveGomez](https://twitter.com/DaveGomez).

**ISSUES WHICH ARE QUESTIONS WILL BE CLOSED**
